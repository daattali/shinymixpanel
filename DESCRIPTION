Description: Easily track user interactions ("events") and user data from
    'Shiny' apps to Mixpanel. Events can also be tracked in plain 'R' scripts
    that are not 'Shiny' apps. Event data in 'Shiny' apps is sent to Mixpanel
    via the browser by default, or via server API calls if an ad blocker is
    used. Mixpanel <https://mixpanel.com> is an analytics platform that allows
    you to view all tracked event data in convenient dashboards online.
